## Statistics

Canada: 15% of Frist Nation Communicties are under a drinking water advisory

Ontario: 35% of First Nation Communities are under a drinking water advisory

In 2015, there were drinking water advisories in 126 First Nations. The Trudeau Government committed to resolving them by March 2021, but they failed to provide all the funding required to meet that deadline. Advisories still exist in 33 First Nation communities.

Some advisories date as far back as 1995 - like Shoal Lake 40 First Nation.

A single drinking water advisory can mean as many as 5,000 people lack access to safe, clean drinking water.

#### Notes

-   Drinking water advisories are issued to warn people to not drink water that may be unsafe or is known to not be safe based on water quality test results.

#### Quotes

-   "Our people could just go to the lake for everything. That was before all these things like the (pulp) mills and mercury poisoning. Our people drink that water and got poisoned by it." - Parenteau from the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation

-   "You wouldn't even think you're in Canada. They're living in Third World Conditions. And we're living in a first-world country. It should not be like this"

-   "Access to safe drinking water is a basic human necessity. I don't believe anyone would say that this is in any way an acceptable situation in Canada in 2021."
